	<h1>A brief history of the participating countries 15 years after the war.</h1><hr>

	<p> Finland began post-war reconstruction, maintaining its independence but had to cede part of its territory to 
		the Soviet Union and it was not until 1950 (10 years later) that the reconstruction of its economy and infrastructure began. 
		the Soviet Union began post-war reconstruction under the leadership of Joseph Stalin until his death in 1953. 
		After Stalin's death, there was a power struggle and eventually Nikita Khrushchev came to power, 
		which caused many significant changes, some good and some bad.

	<h1>Analysis of the Winter War and Who Was Justified</h1><hr>

	<p> We know the war started because the Soviet Union (USSR) wanted to expand its empire further West so 
		they tried to invade Finland. The Soviet forces thought Finland would offer no resistance but were 
		actually fought off by them. I think judging by the fact the Soviet Union w recklessly invaded a peaceful 
		country without consideration for the civilians that would be affected by the conflict, I believe Finland 
		is more justified here because they were defending their land and had no choice.
