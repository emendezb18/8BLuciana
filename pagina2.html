    <hr><h2><b>Political Change</b></h2>
        <p>The outcome of the war and the surprising victory of Finland directly affected
        decisions made by the German and Soviet armies throughout WW2. This is because once Germany saw 
        that a small and weak country like Finland could win a war against the Soviet Union, they underestimated 
        the true power of the Soviet army. Not only this, but the confilct also showcased the lack of power and authority
         of the League Of Nations, who were supposed to prevent war between their members but failed to intervene when the USSR tried to invade Finland.

        <h2><b>Analisys of Who Was Justified</b></h2>
            <div id= analisis> <p>We know the war started because the Soviet Union (USSR) wanted to expand its empire further West so they 
            tried to invade Finland. The Soviet forces thought Finland would offer no resistance but were actually fought
            off by them. I think judging by the fact the Soviet Union w recklessly invaded a peaceful country without
            consideration for the civilians that would be affected by the conflict, I believe Finland is more justified 
            here because they were defending their land and had no choice.</div>
